# My-first-good-looking-web-page

This is my first time building a web site from scratch and styling it using only a picture of the desired design. It's gonna be a great experience
and i'm really excited to start coding. 

I complete it, it take me a bit longer than what i expect.
Testing different codes to style it makes the journey enjoyable and fun.


I used some awesome pictures which i took from https://www.pexels.com/ i'm thankful.

The artistes that shoot the pictures i used in my site :
